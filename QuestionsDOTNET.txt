Student table
Column Name  DataTyoe 
StudentId    int
Name         varchar 
Age          int =


a. Create a model in c#
b. write a query to create table in database. 
c. Write query to create stored procedure in database. 
d. Write ADO.NET Code to insert student into Student Table . 


public void InsertStudent(int studentId, string name, int age)
{
    // Your ADO.NET code to insert data into the Students table
}
